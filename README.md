# Why I Created This Page — and How To Use It

If you’re trying to get into cybersecurity but feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start, this page is for you.

You’ve probably heard a lot of buzzwords like Red Team, SOC Analyst, GRC, Cloud Security—and you’re wondering:
- **What do these roles actually do?**
- **Which one fits my strengths, interests, or background?**
- **How do I even begin my journey?**

I created this resource because cybersecurity isn’t just one job—it’s a whole ecosystem of roles across the entire tech stack, software development lifecycle, and the full spectrum of business risk and defense. If you don’t know how the field is structured, it’s easy to waste time chasing certifications or job titles that don’t actually fit you.

### What’s Inside

- **Career Pathways Table:** A clear breakdown of the most common cybersecurity careers—what each role does, who it’s great for, skills you’ll need, and the tools you should know.
- **Free Hands-On Practice:** Direct links to free, practical labs, environments, and games (like [KC7](https://kc7.com/)) so you can build real-world skills, not just theory.
- **Community & Nonprofit Groups:** Find your people. Get mentorship, support, and opportunities from trusted industry communities and nonprofits.

### How To Use This Guide

1. **Explore the Table:** Scroll through the career pathways. Each row gives you a quick snapshot of what the job is, the type of person it fits, and the essential skills/tools.
2. **Match to Your Strengths:** Before you start chasing certs or applying for jobs, take a moment to see which role(s) feel aligned with your personality, interests, and experience.
3. **Dive Into Free Practice:** Use the linked hands-on labs and resources. Don’t just read—practice! This is how you’ll gain confidence and stand out.
4. **Join a Community:** Cybersecurity is a team sport. Join one or more of the recommended groups to connect with mentors, peers, and opportunities.
5. **Build Step by Step:** Pick one role family to start with. Learn the basics, build your skills, and grow from there. You don’t have to do everything at once.

### Why This Matters

Every cybersecurity role connects to the bigger picture. Whether you’re interested in defending systems (Blue Team), breaking them ethically (Red Team), running risk assessments (GRC), building secure apps (Security Engineer), or educating people (Security Awareness)—there’s a place for you.

**Understanding the map is the most important first step.** It lets you make smart moves, not random ones.

If you’re not sure where to start:
- Pick your top two roles from the table.
- Try out the free labs and resources listed.
- Join a community and ask questions.

And remember—cybersecurity is for everyone. You belong here.
